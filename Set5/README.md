## Tame of Thrones
My solution to the GeekTrust backend problem set Tame of Thromes. This is a C# solution containing two seperate console application for the two seperate problems in the problem set. Both the console applications run on the same engine.

## Solution status
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/prajnanBhuyan/GeekTrust/workflows/Set%205%20Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/prajnanBhuyan/GeekTrust/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Set+5+Build+and+Test%22)

## Framework used
- [.NET Core 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) to create the application 
- [Cake Build](https://cakebuild.net/) to create the build scripts

## Code Example
I plan on updating the project a little further. Will update with code examples after that.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Assumptions:
1. The other kingdoms simply ignore any future messages sent to them once they recieve their first message. This behavious can be easily changed so as to mimic kingdoms getting offended on not having their emblem in the message and breaking off alliances that were already in place.

2. Set a limit for the ballot rounds so that in an unfortunate event we don't go on going forever.

3. A competing kingdom WILL compose a message for another competing kingdom and can posibbly be one of the 6 that the high priest decides to send out as understood by point 2 of **Rules to decide allegiance by a kingdom**:
    *If the receiving kingdom is competing to be the ruler, they will not give their allegiance even if the message they received is correct.*

4. Once a message is sent out, the high priest burns it in the holy flame so as to not send it out a second time by mistake.

5. If three or more competing kingdoms are entered and one of them is invalid, the ballot process is conducted between between the two or more more valid kingdoms.
